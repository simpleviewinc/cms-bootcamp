        <h2>Destination Thrive</h2>
        <h3>Objective: Create omni-channel synergy</h3>
        <p>
          This is the time to fully leverage your hard work and thrive. During
          this phase, attention should be given to creating omni-channel
          synergy, syncing your messaging and channels from top to bottom. Scale
          high performing channels and fully harvest the demand your top of
          funnel awareness campaigns have been creating. Use insights gained
          from your contact lists, data, and web analytics to do prospecting and
          build look-a-like audiences for incremental growth.
