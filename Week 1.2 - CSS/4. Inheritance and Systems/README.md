# Inheritance and Systems

Create the needed CSS to make a system of buttons that could be used in different contexts.

Each button should have the following:
- [ ] Border Radius of 4px
- [ ] Padding of 12px above and below with 32px of padding on the sides
- [ ] Text color should be black

We need buttons for the following use cases:
- A Default button style for general use around the site
- A Primary button style used to direct a user's attention to the action we want them to take
- A Link button style that doesn't appear to have any of the typical button chrome and is just text
- A Danger button style that indicates that clicking it will cause a destructive action

| Type    | Color          |
|---------|----------------|
| Default | `#f5f5f5`      |
| Primary | `#90CDF4`      |
| Link    | `transparent`  |
| Danger  | `#FEB2B2`      |

Your CSS should make sufficient use of inheritance and the cascade in order to keep things tidy and simple. The class names you use should also make it clear to someone reading your code what they do and how they work.

Add your code to the provided HTML file.
