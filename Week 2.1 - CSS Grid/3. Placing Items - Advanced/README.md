# Placing Items - Advanced

Use CSS Grid to place the letters diagonally going downward from left to right starting with the 2nd row. You'll see some blue placeholders showing where your letters need to eventually be.

Be aware, as you place the letter in their correct positions, the placeholders will shift around. Once you've placed a letter, it's best to delete the respective placeholder element in order to keep the remaining placeholders in their correct positions until they can all be replaced with the appropriate letters.

Once all the letters are in their final positions, add some CSS to make them stick to the top of the viewport as you scroll down the page. Here's a hint, you'll only need 2 lines of CSS to add this functionality for all the letters.
